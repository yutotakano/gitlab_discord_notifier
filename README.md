# GitLab -> Discord notifier

This repo contains two bash scripts for notifying a Discord server of GitLab repository updates, like how the GitHub webhook does it.

\* Created for the ETH ZÃ¼rich Game Programming Lab project. This is released without any support or update plans, so if you are looking for something like this, please take it as inspiration as I can't guarantee full functionality in your environments.

## Scripts

1. The first script sends a notification message to the given webhook URL when new commit hashes are found for the `master` branch on a repository. These are determined by fetching the last 100 commits on the `master` branch, comparing it with the cache from the last run, and finding hashes that are new.
2. The second script sends a notification message to the given webhook URL when a new branch is created on the repository.

These were created for a workflow where project team members create feature/fix branches on the main repo, which get merged into `master` once approved.

## Requirements

- `jq`
- `curl`
- `touch`

Tested only on an Ubuntu 22.04 server.

## Setup

Set up crontab entries to call the two scripts as frequent as you like. Every minute works best for the "instant feedback" feeling of committing and getting a notification.

```
* * * * * cd ~/notifier && ./run_master_commit_notif.sh
* * * * * cd ~/notifier && ./run_branch_creation_notif.sh
```
